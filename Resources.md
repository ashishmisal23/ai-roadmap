## 🚀 Quick Install (All at Once)

If `pip` is already installed and you don’t want to install packages one by one,  
you can run this **single command** in your terminal:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost opencv-python scikit-image pillow tensorflow keras torch torchvision mxnet
````

This will install **all major AI/ML libraries in one go**.

## Data Science Libraries

These libraries help you **work with data**, perform analysis, and create visualizations.

### 1. NumPy

* Used for numerical computing and working with arrays.
* Required by almost every AI/ML library.
* Install:

  ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```

### 2. Pandas

* Helps with data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
* Very useful for working with CSV, Excel, and tabular data.
* Install:

  ```sh
  pip install pandas
  ```

### 3. Matplotlib

* Used to create charts, graphs, and plots.
* Great for understanding data visually.
* Install:

  ```sh
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

### 4. Seaborn

* Built on top of Matplotlib.
* Makes data visualization easier and more attractive.
* Install:

  ```sh
  pip install seaborn

## How to Install Packages

To install any Python package:

1. Open **Terminal** (macOS/Linux) or **Command Prompt / PowerShell** (Windows)
2. Run:

   ```sh
   pip install <package_name>
   ```
3. Wait for the installation to finish

### Example

```sh
pip install numpy
```

To install **multiple packages together**:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
